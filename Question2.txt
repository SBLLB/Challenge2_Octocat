When you fork a repo, you set up an â€œorigin" branch. This origin branch is a clone of your fork repo, from which you push and pull. "Upstream" is a name for the main repo, from where you pull and keep a clone of your fork updated, but you don't have push access to it.

To add an upstream remote $ git remote add upstream <URL>.
